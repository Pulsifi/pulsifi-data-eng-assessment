- ~profile~ table contains the profile record with their ID, name and gender
- ~action~ table contains the type of actions that a profile can execute
- ~profile_action~ table records the actions executed by each profile

Write a query that displays the last two actions executed by each profile with the following conditions:
- one row per profile, showing the respective name and gender, last two actions executed by the profile
- if there is no action executed by a profile, display ~NULL~
